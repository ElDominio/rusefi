# Work Report

## 2026-07-14 - Investigation: "Malformed Packet: packet length" in USB.pcapng

What was done:
- Analyzed USB.pcapng (USBPcap capture of the rusEFI ECU USB link, device address 7)
  using tshark to explain the "malformed packet" warnings.

Findings:
- Protocol hierarchy: 84926 frames, mostly USB mass storage (usbms/scsi) plus 2 CDC
  (usbcom) control frames. 23 SCSI frames + 1 URB frame flagged _ws.malformed.
- The 23 usbms malformed frames are ALL the same case: the device reply to
  SCSI Mode Sense(6) (opcode 0x1a). Wireshark message: "SCSI: length of contained
  item exceeds length of containing item".
- Root cause is a Wireshark dissector strictness issue, NOT bad wire data. The 16-byte
  reply is self-consistent:
      0f 00 00 00  08 0a 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
  Mode Data Length=15 (=total-1), Caching mode page (0x08) with PageLength=0x0a=10.
  SBC-2 mandates the Caching page be 0x12=18 long (20-byte page); rusEFI emits a valid
  but non-standard SHORT caching page. Wireshark decodes the full 20-byte layout, reads
  past the 16-byte buffer, and raises the exception. Windows accepts it -> device works.
- Response is hardcoded in ChibiOS-Contrib USB-MSD SCSI target (os/hal/src/hal_usb_msd.c,
  submodule not checked out locally), driven by
  firmware/hw_layer/mass_storage/mass_storage_device.cpp.
- Frames 27759-27772 "USBPcap did not recognize URB Function code" are a USBPcap capture-
  driver limitation, unrelated to rusEFI traffic.

Decisions:
- Classified as cosmetic; no code change made. Not a functional defect.

Validation:
- tshark -z io,phs, per-frame -V dissection, and raw -x hex confirmed the byte layout
  and that all 23 malformed frames share the Mode Sense(6) cause.

Open follow-ups:
- Optional cleanup if the warning ever matters: set the Caching mode page length to 0x12
  and pad the page to the full 20 bytes, or drop the caching page from the Mode Sense
  reply. Lives upstream in ChibiOS-Contrib hal_usb_msd.c.

## 2026-07-14 - SD ECU<->PC switch soak sandbox + USB CDC link-drop investigation

What was done:
- Created a headless soak sandbox SdEcuPcCycleSandbox in the :ui test subproject
  (java_console/ui/src/test/java/com/rusefi/SdEcuPcCycleSandbox.java), modeled on the
  purple-gateway SdPcToEcuSwitchSandbox. It cycles the SD card ECU/logging <-> PC/MSD 10
  times, 20s dwell per mode, confirming each switch via the sd_present / sd_logging_internal
  / sd_msd output channels, and reports a pass/fail tally. Added Gradle task :ui:runSdCycle.
- Initialized two uninitialized git submodules required by the Java build:
  java_console/peak-can-basic (missing peak.can.basic.* -> :ecu_io compile fail) and
  java_console/luaformatter (missing neoe.formatter.lua -> :ui compile fail).

Result of the run (COM149, purple-gateway fw, USB-powered only / no +12V):
- Cycle 1 fully succeeded BOTH directions. PC/MSD->ECU no longer hits FR_DISK_ERR: firmware
  logged "SD: switched from PC/MSD to ECU/logging" and opened log file re_10.mlg; status bits
  confirmed sd_logging_internal=1.
- ~1.5s after the ECU switch the host CDC serial link dropped:
  "output channels: executeCommand failed: java.io.IOException: write failed: wrote 0 but
  expected 11", COM149 closed. Never recovered, so cycle 2's first command got no response and
  the soak aborted at 1/20. Sandbox behaved correctly - it detected and reported the drop.

Root cause (investigated, code-evidenced):
- CDC console and USB mass storage are interfaces on ONE composite USB device (USBD1). The
  config descriptor is fixed at 3 interfaces - MSD IF0 + CDC-control IF1 + CDC-data IF2, 98
  bytes (usbcfg.cpp DESCRIPTOR_SIZE/NUM_INTERFACES). MSD is always present in the enumerated
  descriptor whenever HAL_USE_USB_MSD is built in.
- The SD mode switch does NOT re-enumerate or reconfigure USB. attachMsdSdCard /
  deattachMsdSdCard (mass_storage_init.cpp) merely hot-swap LUN1's backing block device
  between the real SD card and the null device ND1 on the already-running MSD controller.
- Causal chain: PC/MSD->ECU calls deattachMsdSdCard() which swaps LUN1 (SD card -> ND1) while
  Windows still has that mass-storage volume mounted -> the medium vanishes under the mounted
  volume -> the Windows usbstor stack resets/re-enumerates the whole composite device to
  recover -> firmware gets USB_EVENT_RESET/SUSPEND, whose handler calls sduSuspendHookI(&SDU1)
  (usbcfg.cpp:446), tearing down the CDC channel -> host CDC write returns 0, COM149 drops.
- It is host-side (write wrote 0 = port handle invalidated), not a firmware stall: the switch
  completed cleanly, logging started, and the device kept emitting messages up to the drop.

Remediation directions (not implemented - investigation only):
- Don't swap the MSD LUN to a dead null device under a mounted volume. Instead present a stable
  medium or return SCSI "not ready / medium not present" (unit attention) so Windows performs an
  orderly media-eject rather than treating it as a device fault and resetting the port.
- Or signal proper SCSI medium-removal / unit-attention before switching so the host dismounts
  cleanly.
- Host-side, for a true 10x soak: reconnect LinkManager after each switch (treat the CDC drop
  as expected re-enumeration). The current sandbox intentionally reports it instead.
- The existing USB.pcapng capture can confirm the host-issued bus reset around a mode switch.

Validation:
- ./gradlew :ui:compileTestJava BUILD SUCCESSFUL after submodule init.
- ./gradlew :ui:runSdCycle exercised against real hardware; full log captured.

Open follow-ups:
- Decide remediation approach (firmware SCSI media-eject vs host-side reconnect).
- Consider gating: the soak cannot complete 10 cycles over one connection until the CDC drop is
  addressed.

## 2026-07-14 - SD indicator/output-channel name reuse between SdEcuPcCycleSandbox and .ini

What was done:
- Removed the duplicated magic strings sd_present / sd_logging_internal / sd_msd that existed
  independently in output_channels.txt (bit field names), tunerstudio.template.ini (6 indicator
  expressions) and SdEcuPcCycleSandbox.java (SensorCentral lookups). They now flow from a single
  source of truth via the existing code generation.

Change inventory:
| File                                                        | Change                                                          |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| firmware/integration/rusefi_config_shared.txt               | new OUTPUT_CHANNEL_SD_PRESENT / _SD_LOGGING_INTERNAL / _SD_MSD quoted defines |
| firmware/console/binary/output_channels.txt                 | the 3 SD bit fields renamed to @#OUTPUT_CHANNEL_SD_...#@ references |
| firmware/tunerstudio/tunerstudio.template.ini               | 6 indicator lines reference @#OUTPUT_CHANNEL_SD_...#@           |
| java_tools/.../ReaderStateImpl.java (config_definition_base)| handleBitLine now applies variable substitution to the bit name (comment stays templated, matching plain-field parsing) |
| java_tools/.../ConfigFieldParserTest.java                   | new testBitNameViaVariableReference                             |
| java_console/.../SdEcuPcCycleSandbox.java                   | uses VariableRegistryValues.OUTPUT_CHANNEL_SD_* constants       |
| java_tools/version/.../UiVersion.java                       | CONSOLE_VERSION -> 20260714                                     |

Key decisions and why:
- Constants live in rusefi_config_shared.txt because it is prepended by BOTH pipelines that need
  them: gen_config_common.sh (template .ini + VariableRegistryValues.java) and the LiveData.yaml
  output_channels entry (LiveDataProcessor parsing output_channels.txt).
- Used the existing @#NAME#@ quote-stripping substitution (same as TS_HELLO_COMMAND usages) so the
  quoted define yields a bare identifier in struct field names and { } indicator expressions while
  generating a proper Java String constant.
- handleBitLine substitution was narrowed to the name part only: applying it to the whole line
  expanded @@...@@ comment templates at parse time, which changed engine_state_generated.h
  (clutchDownState comment). The narrowed version keeps every generated artifact byte-identical.
- Did not resurrect the deleted generated TsOutputs.java (removed in #6711); defines + existing
  VariableRegistryValues generation is the sanctioned mechanism.

Validation:
- ./gradlew :config_definition:test :config_definition_base:test green including the new test.
- gen_live_documentation.sh + gen_config_board.sh f407-discovery: all generated outputs
  (output_channels_generated.h, live_data_fragments.ini, data_logs.ini, board .ini indicator
  lines) byte-identical to committed state; only VariableRegistryValues.java gains the 3 new
  String constants. Board-generated .h/.ini signature/date churn reverted (CI regenerates).
- ./gradlew :ui:compileTestJava BUILD SUCCESSFUL with the sandbox on the generated constants.

Open follow-ups:
- Other magic output-channel names shared between java_console and .ini (e.g. sd_error,
  sd_formating, sd_active_wr/rd) could adopt the same pattern when java code starts using them.

## 2026-07-14 - N52 preset: bake in TPS/PPS calibration from reference tune

What: Ported TPS + PPS calibration out of the "super N52" TunerStudio tune (CurrentTune.msq)
into the `bmwN52()` engine preset in `firmware/config/engines/bmw.cpp`, so a fresh N52 selection
ships with the real throttle-body/pedal calibration instead of raw defaults.

| Field(s)                                                   | Source (msq, volts) | Stored as |
|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| tpsMin / tpsMax                                            | 4.545 / 0.58        | 10-bit ADC via convertVoltageTo10bitADC |
| tps1SecondaryMin / tps1SecondaryMax                       | 0.75 / 4.72         | 10-bit ADC via convertVoltageTo10bitADC |
| throttlePedalUpVoltage / throttlePedalWOTVoltage          | 0.625 / 2.230       | float volts (verbatim) |
| throttlePedalSecondaryUpVoltage / ...WOTVoltage           | 0.947 / 4.197       | float volts (verbatim) |

Key decisions:
- Used shared helpers setTPS1Calibration()/setPPSCalibration() (defaults.h), matching subaru.cpp.
- TPS stored as 10-bit ADC counts (not volts): wrapped msq volts in convertVoltageTo10bitADC
  (= volts*200). PPS stored as float volts, copied through directly. This units split is the main
  porting hazard and is now documented.
- Skipped tps2* fields: msq had them at defaults (0/5, 5/0); N52 runs a single dual-sensor throttle.
- Added #include "defaults.h"; convertVoltageTo10bitADC comes transitively via pch.h.

Docs: new docs/AI/engine_presets.md documents the canned-tune/preset process end to end
(enum -> engine_type_impl.cpp dispatch -> config/engines setup fn), the TPS-vs-PPS units gotcha,
and a step-by-step msq->preset porting recipe.

Validation: static review only - mirrors the established subaru.cpp calibration pattern; all
referenced helpers are declared in the included headers. No generated files touched (presets are
plain code, no gen_config step).

Open follow-ups:
- Confirm on hardware that a defaults-reset N52 reads plausible TPS

## 2026-07-15 - SD card logging: overview doc + code comments (f_expand logic)

What: Documented the SD card logging subsystem and annotated its three core source files.

| File | Change |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| docs/AI/sd_card_logging.md (new)                       | End-to-end overview: SD thread mode state machine (IDLE/ECU/PC/UNMOUNT/FORMAT, all transitions via IDLE), .mlg vs .teeth loggers, FileBufferedWriter path, f_expand pre-allocation, file naming, status channels, console commands |
| firmware/hw_layer/mmc_card.cpp                         | Expanded LOGGER_MAX_FILE_SIZE, f_expand and f_truncate comments; doc pointer in file header |
| firmware/console/binary_mlg_log/binary_mlg_logging.cpp | File-header overview (MLG v2 layout, who owns file lifecycle); comments on writeFileHeader/writeSdBlock/writeSdLogLine/resetFileLogging |
| firmware/console/binary/tooth_logger.cpp               | Comment on freeBuffers/filledBuffers multi-buffering (BigBuffer, interrupt producers -> TS/SD consumers); ToothLoggerWriter() contract incl. 3s idle timeout -> new file |
| CLAUDE.md                                              | Added sd_card_logging.md to Deep Dive AI Guidance list |

Key facts captured (the f_expand logic in particular):
- sdLoggerCreateFile() pre-allocates each log file to 32Mb with f_expand(fd, size, opt=1)
  (allocate-now, contiguous; FF_USE_EXPAND=1 in firmware/ext/FatFS/ffconf.h). All FAT
  updates happen up-front, so writes inside the pre-allocated area never touch FAT
  structures -> sudden power loss loses buffered data but not the filesystem.
- f_expand failure (fragmented card) is deliberately non-fatal: FatFS falls back to
  cluster-by-cluster growth, logging works without the corruption protection.
- sdLoggerCloseFile() f_truncate()s back to actual size; a power-lossed file stays 32Mb
  with trailing garbage.
- Both loggers share sdLoggerCreateFile() (so .teeth files are pre-allocated too) but
  only sdLoggerMlg() enforces the 32Mb rollover cap.

Validation: comment/doc-only changes, no code touched; facts verified against source
(mmc_card.cpp, file_writer.h, ffconf.h FF_USE_EXPAND=1, tooth_logger.cpp, sd_log_trigger.h).

Open follow-ups: none.

## 2026-07-15 - Lua scripting API: categorized hook inventory doc

What: Reviewed every custom Lua method registered around lua_hooks.cpp and documented
them in a new docs/AI/lua_scripting.md, grouped into 11 categories.

| File | Change |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| docs/AI/lua_scripting.md (new) | Full inventory of Lua hooks by category: input reads, virtual sensors, virtual switches, closed-loop trims, cut/disable controls, PWM/DAC outputs, CAN, config/calibration access, state queries, luaaa helper classes, framework/test hooks; plus registration-site map, indexing conventions, build-flag gating, and an "adding a new hook" recipe |
| CLAUDE.md | Added lua_scripting.md to the Deep Dive AI Guidance list |

Key decisions / findings:
- Registration is spread over four files: lua_hooks.cpp (bulk + luaaa classes),
  lua_hooks_util.cpp (print/interpolate/find*/mcu_standby), lua.cpp (setTickRate,
  onTick dispatch), lua_can_rx.cpp (onCanRx dispatch, global_can_data workaround).
  lua_hooks_ext.cpp is an empty extension point; boardConfigureLuaHooks() is a weak
  board hook with no in-tree overrides.
- Documented the mixed indexing convention explicitly: 1-based (HUMAN_OFFSET) for
  TS-facing entities (CAN bus, curves, tables, TS buttons, gauges), 0-based for
  sensor indices, PWM channels, aux digital inputs, vin().
- Documented flash-saving exclusions (#if !defined(STM32F4) group) and the
  DISABLE_LUA_* / WITH_LUA_* opt-out macros.
- setTickRate code clamps 1..2000 Hz while its comment says 1..200 - doc records
  the code behavior (comment discrepancy left in source, not a functional issue).

Validation: doc-only change; every listed hook, guard macro and constant
(LUA_PWM_COUNT=8, LUA_GAUGE_COUNT=8, LUA_DIGITAL_INPUT_COUNT=8, LUA_BUTTON_COUNT=10,
CMD_BURNCONFIG="burnconfig") verified against source via grep/read of the four
registration files, lua_pid.h and rusefi_config.txt.

Open follow-ups:
- lua.cpp setTickRate comment ("Limit to 1..200 hz") disagrees with clampF(1, x, 2000).
- lua_hooks.cpp has a commented-out hasCriticalReportFile hook referencing issue #7291.

## 2026-07-17 - loss-of-cdc.pcapng analysis: one-shot composite reset from pre-capture MSD wedge

What: Analyzed loss-of-cdc.pcapng (repo root, USBPcap, 24.6 s, captured 2026-07-17
12:25 - i.e. the day AFTER the #9860 fix series landed) against the recent
mass_storage changes. Goal: confirm/refute whether the CDC drop mechanism from
issue #9860 is still present.

Devices in capture: address 21 = the ECU (VID 0483:5740, composite MSD+CDC),
address 22 = PEAK PCAN-USB adapter (19.9k of the 22k packets - unrelated noise).

Timeline (t = seconds from capture start):
- t=0..10.8: ZERO MSD traffic from the ECU. A healthy medium-less device gets
  ~1 Hz Test Unit Ready polls (visible later in this same capture), so at capture
  start usbstor already had one command in flight that never completed - the MSD
  side was already wedged/stuck before the capture began.
- t=7.79: host opens the COM port (GET/SET LINE CODING burst); CDC request/reply
  traffic (TS-style 7/11-byte commands, 1024-byte replies) runs cleanly for 3 s.
- t=10.847: usbstor ~20 s give-up timer fires -> all-endpoint cancel storm on the
  ECU: 10 URBs with USBD_STATUS_CANCELED (0xc0010000) - MSD bulk-IN 0x81 (the
  stuck data/CSW read, pending since before capture start), CDC data 0x82/0x02,
  CDC interrupt 0x83, plus control. This is the loss-of-CDC moment.
- t=10.883: host immediately retries line coding - those control URBs are
  canceled too (device still resetting).
- t=11.03..11.05: MSD recovers: Test Unit Ready on LUN0 and LUN1 -> Check
  Condition -> Request Sense (Good) -> Mode Sense(6) (the known-cosmetic
  "malformed" short caching page). Both LUNs report medium-not-present.
- t=11.28: CDC port re-opens at USB level (line coding OK) but NO data traffic
  follows - the app-level session was dead, host serial layer sat in its ~10 s
  timeout.
- t=12..24.5: clean steady state: 1 Hz TUR polls per LUN, no stalls, no babble,
  no further cancels or resets.
- t=20.79: app fully reconnects (line coding + control line state), TS-style
  traffic resumes. Total user-visible CDC outage: ~10 s (10.85 -> 20.79).

Reading vs the 2026-07-16 fix series (298162eb075..68e7d77c042, all in
firmware/hw_layer/mass_storage/):
- 298162eb0/8a515546c (MSD diag #9838): sdinfo diagnostics incl. per-opcode
  in-flight timer.
- e1feee380 (isCommandAbandoned #9861): 10 s data-phase timeouts on all SCSI
  transfers + CSW via msdUsb*Timeout helpers -> wedged thread self-recovers,
  re-arms bulk-OUT.
- 12b613c59 (#9864): LUN detach now synchronizes with in-flight command
  (m_lunMutex held around scsiExecCmd+CSW) -> kills the SPI double-waiter
  deadlock from the SD mode switch.
- 04331c28f (#9866) + 68e7d77c0 (uaefi): medium-less data-IN commands answered
  with ZLP instead of STALL -> no EP0 clear-halt round-trip near CDC traffic.
The capture is consistent with the fixes WORKING as designed for the recurring
part: exactly ONE reset (the tail of a wedge that began ~9 s before capture,
matching usbstor's ~20 s timer), then 13.5 s of clean behavior with no repeat
reset - the old signature was a reset every ~20 s.

Remaining gap (why one reset still happens): the firmware 10 s data-phase
timeout releases the MSD *thread*, but leaves the *host's* pending IN URB
hanging - firmware just returns to CBW wait and never completes/STALLs the
IN transfer the host is still waiting on. usbstor therefore still escalates to
a full composite reset once, taking CDC down with it. A full fix would complete
the host's data phase on timeout (e.g. STALL the IN endpoint so the host gets
an immediate error -> clear-halt -> CSW path) instead of leaving the URB
pending. Caveat: cannot verify from the capture which firmware build was
flashed or which opcode wedged (the CBW predates the capture); console sdinfo
counters (data-phase timeouts / no-data ZLPs) on the connected unit would
distinguish "fixed firmware, host-side URB gap" from "stale firmware".

Validation: tshark 3.6.2 field-level analysis (usb.usbd_status, endpoints,
SCSI dissection); code cross-checked at HEAD (mass_storage_device.cpp timeout/
ZLP/mutex mechanisms present).

Open follow-ups:
- On data-phase timeout, also complete the host-visible transfer (STALL data-IN
  or arm+flush) so usbstor never needs its 20 s reset - would remove the single
  remaining CDC drop.
- Confirm via sdinfo on hardware whether the flashed build has the 07-16 fixes
  and whether data-phase timeout counters tick.

## 2026-07-17 - MSD data-phase timeout: close the command host-side (stall + phase-error CSW)

What: Implemented the follow-up from the loss-of-cdc.pcapng analysis (previous
entry). Before this change, a data-phase timeout only freed the MSD *thread*
(e1feee380 #9861); the *host's* pending URB was left hanging and the CSW was
skipped, so usbstor still escalated to one full composite-device reset per
wedge - taking the CDC console down for ~10 s each time.

| File | Change |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| firmware/hw_layer/mass_storage/mass_storage_device.cpp | ThreadTask: split the abandoned-command check. BOT reset still skips the CSW (host is not expecting one). Data-phase timeout now STALLs the data endpoint in the CBW's direction (usbStallTransmitI/usbStallReceiveI) and then sends a CSW with CSW_STATUS_PHASE_ERROR and honest residue. sendCsw() now returns whether the host read the CSW; sdinfo prints "N data-phase timeouts (M closed by CSW)" |
| firmware/hw_layer/mass_storage/mass_storage_device.h | sendCsw() -> bool; new m_timeoutCswDeliveredCount counter |

Key decisions and why:
- STALL is the BOT-sanctioned "cannot complete this data phase" signal: a host
  still waiting on its data URB completes it with an error immediately (well
  before usbstor's ~20 s give-up), does a clear-halt on this one endpoint, and
  collects the CSW - recovery stays class-level on the MSD interface, the CDC
  endpoints never notice. A host that already canceled its URBs ignores the
  stall and resets anyway - no worse than before.
- Arming the CSW while the endpoint is still stalled is the exact sequence the
  pre-ZLP medium-less path used (04331c28f), already validated on Windows
  hardware (STALL -> clear-halt -> CSW observed on the wire).
- CSW_STATUS_PHASE_ERROR rather than FAILED: after a broken data phase the
  transport has genuinely lost sync; phase error makes the host run Bulk-Only
  Reset Recovery (class request + clear both halts), fully resynchronizing
  data toggles without any port-level reset. The existing onBulkOnlyResetIsr
  path handles that request.
- Safe to stall: all three msdUsb*Timeout helpers clear the endpoint's
  active flag on timeout, so usbStall*I (which refuses while a transfer is
  active) always takes effect by the time ThreadTask runs the recovery.
- The no-data-ZLP timeout path intentionally keeps its plain 'continue': a
  host that will not even take a zero-length packet is gone from the data
  phase entirely; its next action is a new CBW (accepted normally) or a reset.

Validation: uaefi firmware build (see below). No unit-test coverage exists for
this path (EFI_PROD_CODE + HAL_USE_USB_MSD only). Hardware validation plan:
reproduce the wedge (host abandons a command mid-data-phase), then check
1. sdinfo shows "closed by CSW" ticking together with data-phase timeouts,
2. a capture shows STALL -> clear-halt -> CSW(phase error) -> BOT reset
   instead of the all-endpoint cancel storm,
3. the CDC console stays connected across the event.

Open follow-ups:
- Wedges *below* the USB layer (e.g. blkRead stuck on a dying SD card) are
  still uncovered: no timeout wraps lib_scsi's block-device calls, so such a
  wedge never reaches the new recovery path (lib_scsi is in ChibiOS-Contrib).
- The loss-of-cdc.pcapng pre-capture wedge could not be attributed (stale
  firmware vs blkRead wedge); confirm the flashed build via sdinfo counters.

## 2026-07-23 - alphax-4chan_f7: Lua script (TS page 5) not persisting across reboot

Reported symptom: sending a Lua script to the ECU via console on
alphax-4chan_f7 runs immediately but does not survive a power cycle, while
the same workflow is fine on alphax-s550-pnp (also an F7/mm176 board).

Root cause: page5_s (which holds page5_s::luaScript,
firmware/integration/config_page_5.txt:7) is an "extra page" - on F7 boards
it only gets an internal-flash backend if board.mk both (a) includes
hw_layer/ports/stm32/2mb_flash.mk, which relocates config storage above the
first 1.5MB of flash into 128KB sectors (the only F7 layout where extra-page
piggybacking is valid, per the STM32F7XX guard in
storage_flash.cpp::getExtraPageFlashAddr()), and (b) sets
-DEFI_STORAGE_SD=FALSE so a stale SD custom_page.bin doesn't clobber the
flash copy of page 5 on read (EFI_STORAGE_SD defaults TRUE). Without both,
the page has no backend and silently resets to defaults every boot - live
uploads work because they only touch RAM.

This is the same defect class previously found and fixed on alphax-gold (see
FLASH_DATA_VERSION / page-5 flash persistence history). alphax-4chan's F7
branch in firmware/config/boards/hellen/alphax-4chan/board.mk was never
given the fix; alphax-gold, alphax-s550-pnp, alphax-4K-GDI, uaefi, and
super-uaefi all already include 2mb_flash.mk.

Fix: added the same two lines (2mb_flash.mk include + EFI_STORAGE_SD=FALSE)
inside the ARCH_STM32F7 branch of alphax-4chan/board.mk, mirroring
alphax-s550-pnp's board.mk verbatim (comments included).

Validation: `./compile_alphax-4chan_f7.sh -j12` builds clean. Flash layout
now shows the same relocated split as alphax-gold (flash0 1504KB / flash1
1504KB, 44.56%/33.34% used) instead of a single un-split flash region.
Hardware validation (flash Lua script, power-cycle, confirm it survives) not
yet performed - firmware image only.

Open follow-ups:
- Flash the built image to hardware and confirm the Lua script (and other
  page 5 fields, e.g. custom lookup tables) survive a real power cycle.
- Consider a compile-time guard (like the existing page5_container_s static
  assert) that fails the build for any F7 board defining page-5-backed
  features without EFI_STORAGE_INT_FLASH properly wired, so this class of
  bug can't recur silently on a new board.

## 2026-07-30 - TCU Input Speed Sensor: "shared with main VSS" toggle

What was done:
- Added a dropdown to the TCU Input Speed Sensor panel letting the user mark
  that sensor as physically the same wire as the main Chassis VSS, instead of
  a second independent input.

Key decisions and why:
- Config field: repurposed the unused `devBit0` placeholder
  (firmware/integration/rusefi_config.txt) as
  `tcuInputSpeedSensorSharedWithVss` rather than growing the struct, avoiding
  a FLASH_DATA_VERSION bump (see FLASH_DATA_VERSION bump history). Removed
  its stale `field = devBit0, devBit0` line from the "Experimental 3" parking
  lot dialog in tunerstudio.template.ini.
- Investigated whether "shared" could simply mean pointing
  tcuInputSpeedSensorPin at the same physical pin as
  vehicleSpeedSensorInputPin. Ruled out: firmware/hw_layer/digital_input/digital_input_exti.cpp
  keeps one ExtiChannel per physical pin index (`channels[16]`); a second
  FrequencySensor::initIfValid() on an already-claimed pin hard-fails via
  firmwareError(CUSTOM_ERR_PIN_ALREADY_USED_2) and returns -1 - two
  independent EXTI registrations on one pin are not possible on STM32.
- Implemented instead as edge fan-out inside FrequencySensor
  (firmware/controllers/sensors/frequency_sensor.{h,cpp}): a FrequencySensor
  can now be initialized via initShared() to skip owning a pin/EXTI callback
  entirely and instead receive the raw edge frequency from another
  FrequencySensor's onEdge() through a new onSharedEdge() path
  (setSharedListener()/m_sharedListener). Each side still applies its own
  biquad filter and its own SensorConverter (VehicleSpeedConverter vs.
  InputShaftSpeedConverter) independently on top of the same raw frequency,
  so filter tuning (vssFilterReciprocal vs issFilterReciprocal) and units
  (km/h via gear ratio vs. RPM via tooth count) stay fully independent even
  though the physical signal is shared.
- firmware/init/sensor/init_input_shaft_speed_sensor.cpp now branches on
  engineConfiguration->tcuInputSpeedSensorSharedWithVss: shared mode calls
  inputShaftSpeedSensor.initShared(...) and attaches it as
  vehicleSpeedSensor's shared listener (extern-declared from
  init_vehicle_speed_sensor.cpp); non-shared mode is unchanged
  (initIfValid on tcuInputSpeedSensorPin). Both init and deinit paths clear
  the listener to avoid a stale pointer across a mode switch or engine
  reconfiguration.
- TS UI (tunerstudio.template.ini, inputSpeedSensorPanel): added the
  "Shared with main VSS" field; "Input Pin" is now hidden when shared is
  enabled; "Filter parameter" stays visible either way since it still
  applies to the shared reading. tcuInputSpeedSensorTeeth is left
  independently user-editable in both modes (not auto-derived from
  vssToothCount) - kept the change minimal since only the pin-sharing
  dropdown was requested.

Validation:
- `./gradlew -p java_tools :config_definition:shadowJar` - rebuilt a stale
  config_definition-all.jar first (unrelated pre-existing issue on this
  branch, see Stale config_definition jar history: a page5_s static_assert
  was failing at 8000 vs 10000 bytes purely from the stale jar, nothing to
  do with this change).
- `unit_tests/test.sh` - full suite compiles and links; 1297/1298 pass. The
  one failure (ClosedLoopFuel.StateBasedRegionMapping, a
  ShortTermFuelTrim::regionForSmState(S::Coasting) mismatch) is unrelated to
  this change - none of the edited files touch STFT/region-mapping code -
  and predates this session's work.
- Confirmed generated INI (firmware/tunerstudio/generated/rusefi_f407-discovery.ini)
  renders the field correctly: `tcuInputSpeedSensorSharedWithVss = bits, U32,
  1680, [18:18], "Disabled", "Enabled"` (defaults to Disabled/not-shared),
  and the Input Pin field's visibility condition
  `{ !tcuInputSpeedSensorSharedWithVss }` is present.
- Not yet built for a real board or tested on hardware.

Open follow-ups:
- Hardware validation: confirm InputShaftSpeed reads sensibly when
  tcuInputSpeedSensorSharedWithVss is enabled and vehicleSpeedSensorInputPin
  is wired to the transmission input shaft sensor.
- Consider whether tcuInputSpeedSensorTeeth should warn/default from
  vssToothCount when shared is enabled, if users find the duplicate field
  confusing in practice.

## 2026-07-31 - A/C pressure fan mode: pressure is now the command, independent of compressor state

What was done:
- Fixed `FanController::enabledForAcByPressure()` (firmware/controllers/modules/fan_control/fan_control.cpp)
  in the existing `EFI_AC_PRESSURE_FAN` / `fan_ac_mode_e::Pressure` feature: previously it
  required `acActive` (A/C compressor currently enabled) AND a valid AcPressure reading before
  the fan could be commanded on. Per user direction, when a fan is set to Pressure mode the
  high-side pressure reading is the command by itself - if pressure is over the On threshold,
  the fan turns on regardless of whether the A/C compressor is currently engaged (e.g. static
  heat soak with the clutch open still raises high-side pressure and should still get airflow).
- Dropped the now-unused `acActive` parameter from `enabledForAcByPressure()` (and its call site
  in `FanController::getState()`); Relay mode is untouched and still gates on `acActive`.
- Updated the `fan1AcMode`/`fan2AcMode` field docs and the struct comment block in
  firmware/integration/config_page_6.txt to state that Pressure mode is independent of
  compressor state.

Decisions:
- Scoped strictly to the on/off relay-mode fan logic (`getState`/`enabledForAcByPressure`).
  Left the PWM-mode A/C adder path (`onSlowCallbackPwm`, still keyed off `acActive` via
  `getPwmAcAdder()`) untouched - it's a separate pre-existing TODO (pressure-proportional PWM
  curve) not part of this request.

Validation:
- Added `Actuators.FanAcPressureModeIgnoresCompressorState` in
  unit_tests/tests/actuators/test_fan_control.cpp: with the mock A/C compressor OFF, drives
  AcPressure sensor above/below the on/off thresholds and confirms the fan follows pressure
  alone (also covers invalid-pressure-reading fail-safe: fan not commanded on).
- `unit_tests/test.sh Actuators.FanAcPressureModeIgnoresCompressorState` - passes.
- Full `test.sh "Actuators.Fan*"` re-run after the (separately fixed) Oil Life Monitor
  gauge-name-length codegen issue was resolved: codegen and build now succeed; all 10
  Actuators.Fan* tests pass, including the new
  Actuators.FanAcPressureModeIgnoresCompressorState.

Open follow-ups:
- Consider whether the PWM-mode A/C adder should eventually get the same pressure-is-the-command
  treatment as the relay-mode path (existing TODO in fan_control.cpp).
